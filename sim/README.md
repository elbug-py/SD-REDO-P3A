To run, execute the following:

`python cleverhub_sim.py [platform_ip] [platform_port] [user] [pass] [home]`

Where:
 * [platform_ip] is the IP of where your platform is running. Initially it will likely be localhost.
 * [platform_port] is the port your platform is listening on.
 * [user] is the user name the CleverHub will use to connect to your platform.
 * [pass] is the password he CleverHub will use to connect to your platform.
 * [home] is the name the CleverHub will use to identify itself when connecting to the platform.
	
The simulator simulates the passage of time for some devices, and allows you to simulate changes in the environment through commands in its console.
